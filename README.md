# Notification Badge Desensitizer

This Chrome extension will override the color on the notification badge on sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. from red to gray.

These badges are colored red in order to get our attention. The color creates a fictitious urgency which we feel obliged to deal with. By changing the color we get to take back some control of our attnetion.
